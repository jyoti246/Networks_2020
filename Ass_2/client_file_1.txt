ANANYA
:
I
have
always
wanted
to
be
an
actor.
Just
because
my
dad
has
been
an
actor,
I
will
never
say
no
to
an
opportunity
to
act.
My
dad
has
never
been
in
a
Dharma
film,
he
never
went
on
'Koffee
With
Karan'.
So,
it's
not
as
easy
as
people
say.
Everyone
has
their
own
journey
and
their
own
struggle
SIDDHANT:
Jahaan
humaare
sapne
poore
hote
hai,
waha
inke
struggle
shuru
hote
hai.
